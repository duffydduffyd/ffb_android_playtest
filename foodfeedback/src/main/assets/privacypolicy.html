<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 130%"><b>What information
do we collect?</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 130%">
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 130%">We collect
information in two ways:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 130%">
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 130%; text-align:left;"><b>1. When you give
it to us or give us permission to obtain it.</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 130%">
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 130%; text-align:left; ">When you sign up for
or use our products, you voluntarily give us certain information.
This can include your name, profile photo, kudos, comments, likes,
email address you used to sign up, and any other information you
provide us. If youre using Food Feedback on your mobile
device, you can also choose to provide us with location data.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 130%">
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 130%; text-align:left;">You also may give us
permission to access your information in other services. For example,
you may link your Facebook or Twitter account to Food Feedback, which
allows us to obtain information from those accounts (e.g., your
friends or contacts). The information we obtain from those services
often depends on your settings or their privacy policies, so be sure
to check what those are.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 130%">
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 130%; text-align:left;"><b>2. We also get
technical information when you use our products or use websites or
apps that have Food Feedback features.</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 130%">
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 130%; text-align:left;">These days, whenever
you use a website, mobile application, or other Internet service,
theres certain information that almost always gets created and
recorded automatically. The same is true when you use our products.
Here are some of the types of information we collect:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 130%">
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.03in;  margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 130%; text-align:left;">
&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Log Data. When you use Food Feedback or go to a webpage or
use an app that has Food Feedback features (like our Kudos
button), our servers automatically record information (log
data) including information that your browser sends whenever
you visit a website or your mobile app sends when youre using
it. This log data may include your Internet Protocol address, the
address of the web pages you visited that had Food Feedback features,
browser type and settings, the date and time of your request, how you
used Food Feedback, and cookie data.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 130%">
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.03in;  margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 130%; text-align:left;">
&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Cookie data. Depending on how youre accessing our
products, we may use cookies (a small text file sent by
your computer each time you visit our website, unique to your Food
Feedback account or your browser), or similar technologies to record
log data. When we use cookies, we may use session
cookies (that last until you close your browser) or persistent
cookies (that last until you or your browser delete them). For
example, we may use cookies to store your language preferences or
other Food Feedback settings so you dont have to set them up
every time you visit Food Feedback. Some of the cookies we use are
associated with your Food Feedback account (including personal
information about you, such as the email address you gave us), and
other cookies are not.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 130%">
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.03in;  margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 130%; text-align:left;">
&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Device Information. In addition to log data, we may also
collect information about the device youre using Food Feedback
on, including what type of device it is, what operating system youre
using, device settings, unique device identifiers, and crash data.
Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on
what type of device youre using and its settings. For example,
different types of information are available depending on whether
youre using a Mac or a PC, or an iPhone or an Android phone.
To learn more about what information your device makes available to
us, please also check the policies of your device manufacturer or
software provider.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 130%">
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 130%"><b>How do we use the
information we collect?</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 130%">
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 130%; text-align:left;">We use the
information we collect to provide our products to you and make them
better, develop new products, and protect Food Feedback and our
users. For example, we may log how often people use two different
versions of a product, which can help us understand which version is
better.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 130%">
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 130%; text-align:left;">We also use the
information we collect to offer you customized content, including:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 130%">
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.03in;  margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 130%; text-align:left;">
&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Suggesting coaches you might like. For example, if youve
indicated that youre interested in a coach that is very
supportive, we will attempt to provide prospective coach choices that
have indicated they have this profile;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.03in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 130%">
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.03in;  margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 130%">
&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Showing you ads you might be interested in.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 130%">
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 130%">We also use the
information we collect to:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 130%">
</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.03in;  margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 130%; text-align:left;">
&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Send you updates (such as when certain activity, like you
are sent photos or comments, happens on Food Feedback), newsletters,
marketing materials and other information that may be of interest to
you. For example, depending on your email notification settings, we
may send you weekly updates to remind you to get back on Food
Feedback. You can decide to stop getting these updates by updating
your account settings (or through other settings we may provide).</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.03in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 130%">
</p>
<p style="margin-left:0.03in;  margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 130%; text-align:left;">
&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Help your friends and contacts find you on Food Feedback.
For example, if you sign up using a Facebook account, we may help
your Facebook friends find your account on Food Feedback when they
first sign up for Food Feedback. Or, we may allow people to search
for your account on Food Feedback using your email address.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.03in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 130%">
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.03in;  margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 130%">
&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Respond to your questions or comments.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 130%">
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 130%; text-align:left;">The information we
collect may be personally identifiable (meaning it can
be used to specifically identify you as a unique person) or
non-personally identifiable (meaning it cant be
used to specifically identify you). We use both types of information,
and combinations of both types, as described above. We may use or
store information wherever Food Feedback does business, including
countries outside your own.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 130%">
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 130%"><b>What choices do
you have about your information?</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 130%">
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 130%; text-align:left;">Our goal is to give
you simple and meaningful choices over your information. If you have
a Food Feedback account, many of the choices you have on Food
Feedback are built directly in to the product or your account
settings. For example, you can:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 130%">
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.03in;  margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 130%; text-align:left;">
&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Access and change information in your profile page at any
time, choose whether your profile page is available to search
engines, or choose whether others can find your Food Feedback account
using your email address;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 130%">
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.03in;  margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 130%; text-align:left;">
&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Link or unlink your Food Feedback account from an account on
another service (e.g., Facebook or Twitter). For some services (like
Facebook), you can also choose whether or not to publish your
activity on Food Feedback to that service.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.03in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 130%">
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.03in;  margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 130%; text-align:left;">
&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Create or be added to a closed community. Closed communities
are visible to you and other participants in the community, and any
participant may choose to make the contents of the board available to
anyone else. For example, another participant may invite someone else
to the community, make the community available to an app they use to
view Food Feedback, or even just take an image from the board and
email it to their friends. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 130%">
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.03in;  margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 130%; text-align:left;">
&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Close your account at any time. When you close your account,
well deactivate it and remove your from Food Feedback. We may
retain archived copies of your information as required by law or for
legitimate business purposes (including to help address fraud and
spam).</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 130%">
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 130%; text-align:left;">You may have choices
available to you through the device or software you use to access
Food Feedback. For example:</p>

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.03in;  margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 130%; text-align:left;">

control cookies or other types of local data storage;</p>

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.03in;  margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 130%; text-align:left;">
&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Your mobile device may provide you with choices around how
and whether location or other data is shared with us.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 130%">
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 130%; text-align:left;">To learn more about
these choices, please see the information provided by the device or

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 130%">
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 130%; text-align:left;">Food Feedback is a
tool people use to share their meals, create their food inspirations,
make them a reality, and inspire others in the process. You may also
provide us with profile page information that that anyone can view.
The other limited instances where we may share your personal
information include:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 130%">
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.03in;  margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 130%; text-align:left;">
&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;When we have your consent. This includes sharing information
with other services (like Facebook or Twitter) when youve
chosen to link to your Food Feedback account to those services or
publish your activity on Food Feedback to them. For example, you can
choose to publish your kudos to Facebook or Twitter.</p>

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.03in;  margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 130%; text-align:left;">
&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;We may employ third party companies or individuals to
process personal information on our behalf based on our instructions
and in compliance with this Privacy Policy. For example, we may share
data with a security consultant to help us get better at identifying
spam or with our accountants to make sure were keeping the
books right. In addition, third party providers may collect some of
the information we request on our behalf.

&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;If we believe that disclosure is reasonably necessary to
comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the
safety, rights, or property of the public, any person, or Food
Feedback; or to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security
or technical issues.</p>

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.03in;  margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 130%; text-align:left;">

dissolution, reorganization, or similar transaction or proceeding
that involves the transfer of the information described in this
Policy.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 130%">
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 130%; text-align:left;">We may also share
aggregated or non-personally identifiable information with our
partners or others. For example, we may tell a business using Food
Feedback how many people viewed something they shared, or the
percentage of people who click a on photo after viewing it.</p>
