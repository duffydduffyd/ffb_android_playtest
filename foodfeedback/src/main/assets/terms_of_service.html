location.  EXCEPT FOR DISPUTES THAT QUALIFY FOR SMALL CLAIMS COURT,
ALL DISPUTES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY
ASPECT OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU AND COMPANY, WHETHER BASED IN
CONTRACT, TORT, STATUTE, FRAUD, MISREPRESENTATION OR ANY OTHER LEGAL
THEORY, WILL BE RESOLVED THROUGH FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION BEFORE
A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR INSTEAD OF IN A COURT BY A JUDGE OR JURY AND YOU
AGREE THAT COMPANY AND YOU ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY A
JURY.  YOU AGREE THAT ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL TAKE
PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS AND CLASS ACTIONS
ARE NOT PERMITTED AND YOU ARE AGREEING TO GIVE UP THE ABILITY TO
PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. The arbitration will be administered
by the American Arbitration Association under its Commercial
Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related
Disputes (&ldquo;<B>Supplementary Procedures</B>&rdquo;), as amended
by this Agreement.  The Supplementary Procedures are available online
at <FONT COLOR="#0433ff"><U>http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_015820</U></FONT>.
 The arbitrator will conduct hearings, if any, by teleconference or
videoconference, rather than by personal appearances, unless the
arbitrator determines upon request by you or by us that an in-person
hearing is appropriate.  Any in-person appearances will be held at a
location which is reasonably convenient to both parties with due
consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent
circumstances.  If the parties are unable to agree on a location,
such determination should be made by the AAA or by the arbitrator. 
The arbitrator&rsquo;s decision will follow the terms of this
Agreement and will be final and binding.  The arbitrator will have
authority to award temporary, interim or permanent injunctive relief
or relief providing for specific performance of this Agreement, but
only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the
individual claim before the arbitrator. The award rendered by the
arbitrator may be confirmed and enforced in any court having
jurisdiction thereof.  Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing
in this Agreement will preclude you from bringing issues to the
attention of federal, state or local agencies and, if the law allows,
they can seek relief against us for you.</P>
