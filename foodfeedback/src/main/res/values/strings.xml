    <string name="about_us">Food Feedback originated with my own weight loss struggle. My trainer would ask, "how do you eat?" I\'d shrug and say "pretty good, I guess," though I wasn\'t really paying close attention and wasn\'t losing weight.\n\nOne day I asked, "what if I send you a photo of everything I eat?" It was a simple idea, though somehow I knew it would be important.\n\nI slowed down and started to appreciate what I prepared in the kitchen. I found the most colorful photos were of fresh foods. It was fun to share my food choices while simultaneously improving my nutrition. I enjoyed my food more when it was beautiful and I lost 25 pounds.\n\nThese days, my favorite part is simply sharing my meals with people around the globe, and especially with those I love. Getting photos back from them is just as exciting.\n\nThe team involved with the development of Food Feedback has only made it better, and to them, I am grateful. Eat honest. Eat beautiful. Be creative. Most importantly, be a supportive and generous coach. We are all in this together.\n\nSincerely,\nDenise Duffy</string>
